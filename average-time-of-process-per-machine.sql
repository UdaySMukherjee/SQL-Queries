Table: Activity
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input: 
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+
Explanation: 
There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456


  
# Code
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a1.machine_id, round(avg(a2.timestamp-a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time 
from Activity a1
join Activity a2 
on a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id and a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and a1.activity_type='start' and a2.activity_type='end'
group by a1.machine_id
```

# Explanation of the SQL Code
- SELECT al.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - al.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time: This selects the and calculates the average processing time by taking the difference between end* and start* timestamps, rounding the result to three decimal places.
- FROM Activity al: This specifies the table and assigns it an alias al*.
- JOIN Activity a2: This performs a self-join on the Activity* table with alias * a2*. ON al.machine_id = a2.machine_id AND al.process_id = a2.process_id AND al.activity_type = start' AND a2.activity_type = •end': This join condition pairs the start* and activities for the same machine and process.
- GROUP BY al.machine_id: This groups the results by to calculate the average processing time for each machine.
  
# Detailed Steps
1. Alias Tables: Use * and * a? as aliases for the *Activity* table.
2. Join Tables: Perform a self-join on using the conditions on "machine_id', activity_type• ('start' for and 'end' for a2*).
3. Calculate Time Difference: Calculate the difference between the timestamp* of •end' activity and •start' activity.
4. Compute Average: Use * AVG' to compute the average processing time and to round the result to three decimal places.
5. Group Results: Group by to get the average processing time for each machine.
